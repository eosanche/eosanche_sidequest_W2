Process & Decision Document

On January 27, 2026, I used ChatGPT to help me find the code that is responsible for setting the original position of the blob. It found the code and suggested few lines of code to make it work. I used the code and adjusted values and the environment around the blob to ensure that it works properly.

## On January 27, 2026, I used ChatGPT to help me create the code to develop the bounce effect every time the blob reaches the end of the canvas. It provided several lines of code, but required some intervention by changing the numerical values, as the code provided could not push the blob further.
